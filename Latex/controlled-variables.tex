\section{Controlled Variables}
The controlled variables are a subset of those described in \cite{REMH}.\footnote{With some change of nomenclature. Controlled variables have a ``c'' prefix.} In addition, there is a mode display \cv{md} and a message display \cv{ms}.\footnote{The mode ``off'' is added to that of Fig.~A-4 in \cite{REMH}, and the mode transitions have been changed.}
