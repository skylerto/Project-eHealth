\section{E/R-descriptions}

\subsection{Requirements Descriptions}
\reqm{REQ}
{The system will keep track of Physicians, Patients, Medications, Interactions, and Prescriptions\\}
{ See Table~\ref{tbl:cv} for list of abstract states.\\}
\label{R1}

\reqm{REQ}
{A generalist cannot add a medicine to a prescription if that medicine leads to a dangerous interaction. \\}
{ See Table~\ref{table:monitored} for adding medicine, and Table~\ref{tbl:cv} for dangerous interactions.\\}
\label{R2}

\reqm{REQ}
{An interaction cannot be added if a specialist has not prescribed at least one of the medications.\\}
{ See Table~\ref{table:monitored} for adding interaction, and Table~\ref{tbl:cv}.\\}
\label{R3}

\subsection{Environmental Descriptions}
\reqm{ENV}
{All input to the system will be constrained to the GUI grammer.\\}
{ See Table~\ref{table:monitored} for the list possible monitored events.\\}
\label{E1}

\reqm{ENV}
{A constraint by the grammar will ensure PHYSICIAN\_TYPE is either a generalist or a specialist.\\}
{ See Table~\ref{table:monitored-types} for PHYSICIAN\_TYPE.\\~}
\label{E2}
\noindent \textbf{Rationale}: The operator interface for the nurse is designed in such a way that the increments of the input temperatures from the control interface must change by whole numbers.

\reqm{ENV}
{The DOSE type will be constrained by the GUI grammar to be either mg, or cc.\\}
{ See Table~\ref{table:monitored-types} for DOSE.\\~}
\label{E3}

\reqm{ENV}
{The KIND type will be constrained by the GUI grammar to be either a pill or a liquid.\\}
{ See Table~\ref{table:monitored-types} for KIND.\\~}
