\section{E/R-descriptions}

\subsection{Requirements Descriptions}
\reqm{REQ}
{The system will keep track of Physicians, Patients, Medications, Interactions, and Prescriptions\\}
{.\hl{..}}
\label{R1}

\reqm{REQ}
{The system will output a different response depending on which monitored event occurs. \\}
{\hl{...} \\~}
\label{R2}

\reqm{REQ}
{In \emph{normal} mode, the controller shall activate an alarm whenever 

\begin{mylist}
\item the current temperature falls outside the \emph{alarm} temperature range (either through temperature fluctuation or a change in the alarm range by an operator), or
\item a failure is signalled in any of the input devices (temperature sensor and operator settings).
\end{mylist}~}
{The alarm temperature range is $\mv{al}\upto\mv{ah}$.
Monitored variable \mv{st} 
%in Table~\ref{fig:mv} 
shows ``invalid'' when any of the input signals fail.}
\label{R3}
\noindent \textbf{Rationale}: During normal operation, if any conditions occur that could affect the wellbeing of the infant, the nurse should be notified by an alarm. This could include sensor or interface failure, or current temperature exceeding alarm values - even if this is caused by the nurse adjusting the values.

\subsection{Environmental Descriptions}
\reqm{ENV}
{All input to the system will be assumed as to be constrained to the GUI.\\}
{see table for a list of monitored events.\\~}
\label{E1}

\reqm{ENV}
{.\\}
{ \mv{ah}, \mv{al}, \mv{dh}, and \mv{dl} in Table 1: Monitored Variables.\\~}
\label{E2}
\noindent \textbf{Rationale}: The operator interface for the nurse is designed in such a way that the increments of the input temperatures from the control interface must change by whole numbers.

\reqm{ENV}
{Failure of the sensors or operator settings will cause the status to become invalid.\\}
{If the sensor or operator settings fail, \mv{st} becomes invalid.\\~}
\label{E3}
\noindent \textbf{Rationale}: The environment has ways of detecting failures of the operator interface or the temperature sensor and indicating their status to the controller. The Isolette must constantly be monitoring the status of the sensors and controls to ensure that safe assumptions can be made on their values so as to not endanger the infant.
