\section{Context Diagram}
 
See Fig. A-1 in \cite{REMH}. The System Under Description (SUD) is a computer \emph{controller} to regulate the temperature of the Isolette. Everything else including the Operator Interface (described in \cite{REMH}) is in the ecosystem (i.e. in the environment of the controller). The monitored variables and controlled variables for the controller are in Table~\ref{table:monitored} and 
Table~\ref{tbl:cv}, respectively. For clarity, simplicity and safety, there are some differences between the specifications in this document and the descriptions in \cite{REMH}.\footnote{%
Documented in the write-up to this assignment: \texttt{assign1-spec.pdf}.} 

The differences in the SUD include, it will display an error message as well as the temperature back to the nurse at their station (see \emph{\cv{ms}} in table~\ref{tbl:cv}). The SUD will also employ an alarm as priority when the temperature becomes undesirable (set by the nurse, see \mv{al} in table~\ref{table:monitored}). Finally the SUD will keep track of the Isolette's state, that is it will have more states than the nurse can set (see \emph{\cv{md}} in table~\ref{tbl:cv}). For updated context diagram, see Fig.\ref{fig:modes}.
