\section{Context Diagram}
 
The System Under Description (SUD) is a computer \emph{controller} to keep track of the physicians, patients, patient prescriptions, medications, and medication interactions. The monitored variables and controlled variables for this computer system can be found in Table~\ref{table:monitored} and Table~\ref{tbl:cv} respectively.

The system must keep track of abstract state which isn't available to the user. For a list of the abstract states within the controller see Figure~\ref{abs-state}.
